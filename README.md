About
-----

FileSystem is an application that allows you to browse the content of your iPhone disk, displaying file and folders, files contents, and detailed informations about file and folder permissions.  
No file editing nor folder creation can be done through this application.  
It is intended to developers, to learn about the internal organisation of the iOS file system.

Compatibility
-------------

FileSystem is an universal application, meaning you can use it on iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.  
It requires at least iOS 4.0.  
Latest versions of iOS, as well as latest iOS devices (iPhone 5, iPad Mini) are fully supported.

AppStore Version
----------------

FileSystem used to be available on the AppStore.  
Unfortunately, after a few years of availability, Apple decided to [remove it](http://www.noxeos.com/2012/05/27/apple-kills-filesystem-app/).  
The complete source code is now available freely.
